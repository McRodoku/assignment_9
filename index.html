      <div>
          <h2>You'll also need this equipment:</h2>
              <li>Roasting pan with a rack</li>
              <li>Meat thermometer</li>

              <li>Paper towels</li>

              <br/>
      </div>
      <div>
          <h1>Instructions:</h1>
                <strong>Thaw the turkey</strong>
                    <li>If your turkey is frozen, ensure it's fully thawed before cooking. This can take several days in the<br/> 
                refrigerator, so plan accordingly. Follow the turkey's packaging for specific thawing guidelines.</li>
                <br />
                <br />
                <strong>Preheat the oven</strong>
                    <li>Preheat your oven to 325°F (or 163°C for you Non-Americans that happen to be celebrating<br />
                         Thanksgiving for whatever reason).</li>
                <br />
                <br />
                <strong>Prepare the turkey</strong>
                    <li>Remove any giblets and the neck from the cavities. You can use these for making gravy if you'd like.</li>
                    <li>Rinse the turkey under cold water and pat it dry with paper towels.</li>
                    <li>Season the inside of the turkey with salt, pepper, and optional seasonings.</li> 
                    <li>If you decided to use stuffing, put it inside the turkey.</li>
                <br />
                <br />
                <strong>Truss the turkey</strong>
                    <li>If you took the optional step to truss the turkey, use your cooking twine to tie the legs together<br /> 
                        and secure the wings against the body. Trussing helps the turkey cook evenly and keeps it looking neat.</li>
                <br />
                <br />
                <strong>Prepare the butter</strong>
                    <li>In a bowl, mix the softened butter with salt, pepper, and any additional seasonings you prefer.</li>
                <br />
                <br />
                <strong>Rub the turkey</strong>
                    <li>Gently lift the skin of the turkey and rub the seasoned butter mixture between the skin and the meat.<br />
                        This helps keep the meat moist and adds flavor.</li>
                <br />
                <br />
                <strong>Season the skin</strong>
                    <li>Rub the outside of the turkey with additional salt and pepper, and any extra seasonings you like.</li>
                <br />
                <br />
                <strong>Place the turkey in the roasting pan</strong>
                    <li>Put the turkey on a rack in a roasting pan, breast side up.</li>
                <br />
                <br />
                <strong>Roast the turkey</strong>
                    <li>Loosely tent the turkey with aluminum foil, place it in the preheated oven, and calculate the cooking time.<br />
                        To calculate the cooking time, add 15 minutes per each pound of the turkey.</li>
                <br />
                <br />
                <strong>Baste the turkey</strong>
                    <li>Every 30 minutes, use a baster or brush to baste the turkey with its own juices and/or additional melted butter.</li>
                <br />
                <br />
                <strong>Temp the turkey</strong>
                    <li>Use your meat thermometer to check the turkey's internal temperature. The turkey is done when it reaches 165°F (74°C)<br />
                        in the thickest part of the thigh. For an accurate reading, be sure not to touch the bone with the meat thermometer.</li>
                <br />
                <br />
                <strong>Let the turkey rest</strong>
                    <li>Once the turkey is to temperature, pull it out of the oven, loosely cover with foil, and let it rest for 20-30 minutes.<br />
                        This allows the juices to redistribute and makes the meat more tender and delicious.</li>
                <br />
                <br />
                <strong>Carve it up and serve!</strong>
                    <li>Carve the turkey with a carving knife and serve it with your favorite Thanksgiving side dishes.</li>
                <br />
